## Getting Started (not done editing)

The main important bit is that the React project has `proxy` set to `localhost:8080` in the `package.json` file, and that the Express app listens to port 8080 in `server.js`. Take a look!

You can (and perhaps should) rename the directories `express-back-end` and `react-front-end` if you want-- The name doesn't matter.

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

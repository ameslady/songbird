# Risk Identification & Mitigation

- Will the spotify API work as needed?

  - It won't work on its own. We can use it to pull playlists but will need to use deezer to play audio clips.

- Is the playback API going to work? Is there going to licensing/subscription issues?

  - Not with Deezer as they only provide 30 second previews. But, a drawback is we can't query genres or playlists.

- Is a multiplayer game out of scope? Or, too difficult to demo without being deployed to heroku?
